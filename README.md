Eddie's Paper Writer: Revolutionizing Academic Writing with AI
Welcome to Eddie's Paper Writer, a cutting-edge AI-driven project that redefines the way academic papers are generated and refined. This project leverages the power of advanced language models and a sophisticated Actor-Critic system to produce high-quality, academically rigorous papers with unparalleled efficiency and accuracy.

🌟 Key Features
AI-Driven Paper Generation: Utilizes state-of-the-art language models to generate detailed academic outlines and full papers.

Actor-Critic System: Employs a dual-agent approach where an Actor generates content and a Critic evaluates it, ensuring iterative improvement and academic rigor.

Iterative Refinement: Multiple iterations of content generation and evaluation to refine the paper until it meets the highest standards.

Comprehensive Evaluation: Detailed feedback from the Critic helps identify areas for improvement, ensuring that all aspects of the original prompt are fully addressed.

Flexible and Scalable: Designed to handle a wide range of academic topics and can be easily adapted to different research domains.

🚀 How It Works
Initial Prompt: Start with a detailed research question or topic.

Outline Generation: The Actor generates a comprehensive outline based on the prompt.

Critic Evaluation: The Critic evaluates the outline, providing detailed feedback on structure, completeness, and coherence.

Iterative Refinement: The Actor refines the outline based on the Critic's feedback, repeating the process until the outline is deemed complete.

Full Paper Generation: Using the final outline, the Actor generates a complete academic paper.

Final Evaluation: The Critic evaluates the full paper, ensuring that all sections are fully developed and coherent.

🛠️ Technical Stack
OpenAI API: Powers the language model interactions, enabling high-quality content generation and evaluation.

Tenacity Library: Ensures robust error handling and retry mechanisms for API calls.

Colorama: Enhances logging with colored output for better readability.

JSON: Used for saving and managing evaluation results and feedback.

📊 Performance Metrics
Outline Completeness: Ensures all necessary sections and subsections are included.

Prompt Coverage: Verifies that all aspects of the original prompt are addressed.

Paper Length: Generates papers of approximately 6000 words with a balanced distribution across sections.

Methodology Detail: Provides detailed methodology and experimental sections.

📝 Example Usage
python
复制
api_key = "your_openai_api_key"
initial_prompt = """BTGen-GA: Revolutionizing Behavior Tree Generation with Genetic Algorithm and LLM..."""
compare_responses(api_key, initial_prompt)
📁 Output
Single Actor Outline: single_actor_outline.txt

Single Actor Full Paper: single_actor_full_paper.txt

Actor-Critic Outline: ac_outline.txt

Actor-Critic Full Paper: ac_full_paper.txt

Critic Process: critic_process.json

📚 Comparison
Single Actor vs. Actor-Critic: Compare the quality and completeness of papers generated by a single Actor versus the Actor-Critic system.

Iterations: Track the number of iterations required for the Actor-Critic system to produce a refined paper.
